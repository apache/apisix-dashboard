## How to contribute?

Most of the contributions that we receive are code contributions, but you can
also contribute to the documentation or simply report solid bugs
for us to fix.

## How to report a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


## How to add a new feature or change an existing one

_Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/issues)._ Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone.

* Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
* Includes tests for new functionality.
