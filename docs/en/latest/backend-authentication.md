### How to use this Non-intrusive framework

- **target**: we can use this framework to achieve adding customized authentication method to dashboard
- **implementation**: we use middleware to check user permissions. The way to check can be decided by developer, if not, we provide a default way for developers
- **usage**:

1.we open the switch to adapt the  **default authentication method**:

```shell
feature_gate:
  demoIAMAccess:true
```

â€‹	the default strategy where we use the `casbin` framework to achieve. Also, we can add and delete this route in **`internal/pkg/iam/demo/policy.csv`** that only can be accessed by **admin**

2.Adopt a **customized authentication method**

```shell
# at first, we should close this switch to support customized authentication method
feature_gate:
  demoIAMAcess:false
```

```go
// then, we should create struct to implement this interface
// parameters explanation. identity -> username(user or admin) resource -> url action -> method
// in the method Check, you can customize some way to authenticate these interviewers
// if interviewers aren't permitted to request this resource. you can throw an error
type Access interface {
    Check(identity, resource, action string) error
}

type MyAccess struct{}
func (m MyAccess)Check(identity, resource, action string) error {
	// customized way
}
func main(){
	// add your customized method into APISIX-DashBoard
    ok := SetAccessImplementation(MyAccess{})
	if ok {
		// add successfully
    } else {
		// there is an existing method in dashboard
}
```
