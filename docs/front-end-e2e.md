This project uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) as the front-end E2E test framework.

1. To start the front-end project locally, please refer to [develop](./develop.md) web section.
   
2. Open Cypress test-runner. For the use of test-runner, please refer to [test-runner](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#) Overview.
   ```sh
   yarn cypress:open-dev
   ```
   
3. Write your test examples: please refer to the test examples in the `/web/cypress` directory, or see [RWA](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app) for more examples.

To make it easy for users to develop front-end E2E cases, we use the remote manager-api by default. If you want to use the local manager-api, please read the following instructions:

1. Start the local manager-api service, please refer to [develop](./develop.md) manager-api section.

2. To start the front-end project locally, please refer to [develop](./develop.md) web section. NOTE: You need to change `yarn start` to `yarn start:e2e` when you start.

3. Open Cypress test-runner.
   ```sh
   yarn cypress:open
   ```
