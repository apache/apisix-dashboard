### Sync jsonschema

To sync jsonschema from Apache APISIX, `Lua` 5.1+ and `zip` need to be preinstalled, then execute this command: `api/build-tools/schema-sync.sh $version`.

NOTE: `$version` should be `master` or Apache APISIX's version. 

Example:

```sh
# Using "master"
$ api/build-tools/schema-sync.sh master

# Using Apache APISIX's version
$ api/build-tools/schema-sync.sh 2.0
```
