# Deploy manually

## Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard.git

$ cd apisix-dashboard
```

## Build the manager-api

The `manager-api` is used to provide APIs for Dashboard, just like a bridge between the Apache APISIX and the Dashboard. Here are the steps to build it manually:

1. We need `Go` 1.13+ and `Lua` 5.1+ to be preinstalled.

2. Check environment variables

- enable Go MODULE

```sh
$ go env -w GO111MODULE=on
```

- According to your local deployment environment, check the environment variables in `./api/run.sh`, modify the environment variables if needed. For example, change the ETCD endpoints to your ETCD instances work with APISIX:

```
export APIX_ETCD_ENDPOINTS="127.0.0.1:2379"
```

If you have multiple instances, please use commas to separate:

```
export APIX_ETCD_ENDPOINTS="127.0.0.1:2379,127.0.0.1:3379"
```

- For most users in China, we could use [Goproxy](https://goproxy.cn/) to speed up downloading modules.

```sh
$ go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct
```

3. Build and Run

```sh
$ ./api/run.sh &
```

## Build the frontend

This project is initialized with [Ant Design Pro](https://pro.ant.design). The following are some quick guides for how to use.

1. Make sure you have `Node.js(version 10.0.0+)/Nginx` installed on your machine.
2. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
3. Install dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

4. Build

```sh
$ yarn build
```

5. The bundled files are under `/dist` folder if the step 4 is successful.
6. Move files under `dist` folder to manager-api's `dist` folder, then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser, `8080` is the default listen port of manager-api.
