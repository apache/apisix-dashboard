# Apache APISIX Dashboard

## the relation between dashboard and manager-api

At present, the dashboard is divided into two parts, one is the front-end page and script, and the other is the manager that takes over the front-end api interface.

Compared with the previous apisix-dashboard, we have one more manager module, which is used to encapsulate the apisix admin api, which is more suitable for page element display.

The module call relationship is as follows

The manager-api has its own storage. The currently used mysql, mysql stores some management information other than APISIX internal objects.

When deploying dashboard, we are divided into 3 modules, namely dashboard page, manager-api, and the mysql database that manager-api depends on. The purple part in the figure is the two new modules added this time.

You can also use docker-compose for one-click deployment, refer to [here](./compose/README.md)
