# Apache APISIX Dashboard (Currently considered experimental)

## What's Apache APISIX Dashboard

The Apache APISIX Dashboard is designed to make it as easy as possible for users to operate [Apache APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix) through a frontend interface.

The Dashboard is the control plane and performs all parameter checks; Apache APISIX mixes data and control planes and will evolve to a pure data plane.

This project includes `manager-api`, which will gradually replace `admin-api` in Apache APISIX.

Note: Currently the Dashboard does not have complete coverage of Apache APISIX features, [visit here](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/milestones) to view the milestones.
