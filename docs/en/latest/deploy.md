The Dashboard contains both `manager-api` and `web`, but `web` is _optional_.

The `manager-api` and `web` will be included in this build guide product.

## Prerequisites

Before using source codes to build, make sure that the following dependencies are installed in your environment.

### manager-api

1. [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.13+: For users in mainland China, you can use the following command to speed up the module downloads.

```sh
$ go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct
```

### web

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 10.23.0+
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone -b release/2.6 https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard.git
```

## Build

```sh
$ cd apisix-dashboard
$ make build
```

When the build is complete, the results are stored in the root `output` directory.

Note: `make build` will build `manager-api` and `web`, use the `make help` command to see more commands.

## Launch

1. After the build is complete and before you start, make sure the following dependencies are installed and running in your environment.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/dl-build/) 3.4.0+

2. Check and modify the configuration information in `output/conf/conf.yaml` according to your deployment environment.

3. Launch the Dashboard

```sh
$ cd ./output

$ ./manager-api

# or running in background
$ nohup ./manager-api &
```

4. Without changing the configuration, visit `http://127.0.0.1:9000` to use the dashboard with GUI, where the default username and password are `admin`.

5. Stop the Dashboard

`manager-api` provides a sub command `stop` to quit the program gracefully, just
run:

```sh
$ ./manager-api stop
```

### Optional

6. Running `manager-api` as an OS service.

Without clubbing `manager-api` with external command such as `nohup` (in Unix systems), we also provide a long term solution for running the program as an **operating system managed background service**. The feature is cross-platform, os agnostic and works on well known Linux, Windows and Mac OS distributions.

**Note:** The `manager-api` as a service is listed by the name `apisix-dashboard` under the OS's service manager.

`manager-api` provides a list of sub commands to start and manage the lifecycle of the background service.

```sh
# start Apache APISIX Dashboard service
$ ./manager-api start

# re-install Apache APISIX Dashboard service
$ ./manager-api install

# inspect the status of Apache APISIX Dashboard service
$ ./manager-api status

# stop Apache APISIX Dashboard service. stop can be used with or without service
$ ./manager-api stop

# remove Apache APISIX Dashboard service
$ ./manager-api remove
```

## Working directory

The `output` directory mention above is the default working directory.

You can move the entire directory to any path you want, and use the `-p` to specify it as the working directory.

For example, you can move it to `/usr/local/apisix-dashboard/`

```sh
$ mv ./output/manager-api /usr/local/bin/

$ mv ./output/ /usr/local/apisix-dashboard/

$ manager-api -p /usr/local/apisix-dashboard/
```
