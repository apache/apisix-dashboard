- The master version should be used with Apache APISIX master version.

- The latest released version is [2.15.0](https://apisix.apache.org/downloads/) and is compatible with [Apache APISIX 2.15.x](https://apisix.apache.org/downloads/).

## What's Apache APISIX Dashboard

The Apache APISIX Dashboard is designed to make it as easy as possible for users to operate [Apache APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix) through a frontend interface.

The Dashboard is the control plane and performs all parameter checks; Apache APISIX mixes data and control planes and will evolve to a pure data plane.

Note: Currently the Dashboard does not have complete coverage of Apache APISIX features, [visit here](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard/milestones) to view the milestones.

## Works with APISIX Ingress Controller

Currently, APISIX Ingress Controller automatically manipulates some APISIX resources, which is not very compatible with APISIX Dashboard. In addition, users should not modify resources labeled `managed-by: apisix-ingress-controllers` via APISIX Dashboard.
