# Development Guide

The Dashboard contains both `manager-api` and `web` parts, so you need to start the development environment separately.

## Prerequisites

Before development, refer to this [guide](./deploy.md) to install dependencies.

## Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone -b v2.2 https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard.git
```

## Start developing

```sh
$ cd apisix-dashboard
```

### manager-api

1. Please change the configuration in `api/conf/conf.yaml`.

2. In the root directory, launch development mode.

```sh
$ make api-run
```

3. In the root directory, stop development mode.

```sh
$ make api-stop
```

4. Please refer to the [FAQ](./FAQ.md) about the problem of displaying exception in the dashboard after adding custom plugins or modifying plugin's schema.

5. If writing an back end E2E test, please refer to the [Back End E2E Writing Guide](./back-end-e2e.md)

### web

1. Go to the `web` directory.

2. Please change the `manager-api` address in the `config/defaultSettings.ts` file if needed.
